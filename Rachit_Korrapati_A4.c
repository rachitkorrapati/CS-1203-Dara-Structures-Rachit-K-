/*This code performs a DFS on the graph and prints the vertices in the order they are visited.
The visited array is used to keep track of whether a vertex has been visited or not.
This approach is much more efficient than the Hamiltonian cycle approach for large graphs.
However, it doesnâ€™t guarantee to find a solution if it exists.
It only explores as much of the graph as possible from the given start vertex.
If you want to explore the entire graph, you can run the DFS from all vertices one by one (like a loop).*/
